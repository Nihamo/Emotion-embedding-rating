## ðŸ“˜ Emotion-Based Review Rating Prediction

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model that predicts user ratings by analyzing the emotional and semantic characteristics of e-commerce reviews. Each review is encoded into a 64-dimensional vector representing its emotional and contextual meaning. The objective is to build a model that can accurately estimate ratings across a wide range of review data.

### ðŸš€ Highlights

- Leverages pre-generated emotion-semantic embeddings for input features  
- Supports both regression and classification approaches for rating prediction  
- Lightweight, easy to replicate, and adaptable for various review-based datasets  

### ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

The dataset includes 64-dimensional emotion-semantic embeddings derived from user reviews collected across different e-commerce platforms. Each embedding is associated with a numerical user rating (e.g., from 1 to 5 stars).
